# Matrix.to

Matrix.to is a simple url redirection service for the Matrix.org ecosystem which
lets users share links to matrix entities without being tied to a specific app.
Stylistically it serves as a landing page for rooms and communities.

Matrix.to preserves user privacy by not sharing any information about the links
being followed with the Matrix.to server - the redirection is calculated
entirely clientside using JavaScript, and the link details is hidden behind a
fragment to avoid web clients leaking it to the server. However, acting as a
landing page it may leak your ip to any number of homeservers involved with the
entity linked to while fetching previews. There is an opt out under which no
previews will be loaded.

Anyone is welcome to host their own version of the Matrix.to app - Matrix.to is
**not** a single point of failure on the Matrix ecosystem; if the matrix.to
deployment ever failed, users could trivially copy the room/user/message details
out of the URLs and follow them manually, or change the hostname to point at an
alternative deployment of the service. The Matrix.to service could also be
hosted in an immutable/signed environment such as IPFS to further increase its
availability and avoid tampering.

The matrix.to URL scheme is

| Entity type: | Example URL                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rooms:       | https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org                            |
| Rooms by ID: | https://matrix.to/#/!cURbafjkfsMDVwdRDQ:matrix.org                |
| Users:       | https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org                           |
| Messages:    | https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org/$1448831580433WbpiJ:jki.re |

The #/ component is mandatory and exists to avoid leaking the target URL to the
server hosting matrix.to.

Note that linking to rooms by ID should only be used for rooms to which the
target user has been invited: these links cannot be assumed to work for all
visitors.

(Technically the # and @ in the URL fragment should probably be escaped, but in
practice for legibility we bend the rules and include it verbatim)
